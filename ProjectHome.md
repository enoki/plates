A stack based calculator written in Python/Tk.

It has arithmetic and scientific operations you'd expect from a calculator, with some programming primitives borrowed from Forth.

The original intent was to use it for simple arithmetic, but future enhancements will likely include plotting, multiple stacks, and expanded programmability.
